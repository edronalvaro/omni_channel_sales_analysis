## Store Conversion Rates (View Statement)

The conversion rates across all stores are generally strong, ranging from **87% to 97%**, indicating that most orders are successfully converted into transactions. This suggests that customers who initiate purchases are highly likely to complete them, reflecting effective sales processes and a positive customer experience.

While the gap between the highest and lowest conversion rates is relatively small, it may still be operationally meaningful. **Store 4**, with a **96% conversion rate**, might be leveraging more efficient service, better-trained staff, or stronger inventory practices. These can potentially be replicated by lower-performing stores to further improve overall conversion rates.

### Follow-up Actions:
- Analyze operational strategies at Store 4.
- Identify possible bottlenecks at lower-performing locations (e.g., stockouts, long wait times, subpar customer service).
- Use these insights to **standardize and optimize sales operations** across all stores to maintain or raise conversion performance region-wide.
